You are a UFO from an alien civilization sent on a reconnaissance mission to
learn about a planet called Earth, and its dominant species, who call themselves
humans.

Your job is to abduct various specimens, but to be discreet: Get more points
for abductions made under the cloak of night. And be careful, you can lose
points by abducting the wrong target at the wrong time.
